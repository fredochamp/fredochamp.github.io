I am a senior scientist at [ONERA (DTIS/IVA)](https://www.onera.fr/).

My work is about low-level vision, video processing, computer vision and co-design with applications to optical metrology. My contributions adress optical flow
 for planar PIV, 3D tomography for volumic PIV, 3D Background Oriented Schlieren. Work in co-design deals with developement of  single image DFD techniques and performance modelling 
 for joint sensor/processing optimization.
